# Pi-Pico-Macro-Deck-
Using a Pi Pico from Thales Kit, the Arduino IDE, and knowledge of C++. I built a simple 7-button layout with a WS2812 LED strip that functions like a macro pad for a keyboard. For example this helps with controller input + keyboard input for games so you do not need to reach 
"F1" for example, the task is to make it simplier. In the future I want to make it run media controls. The wiring and inital code started off with the guidance I saw from the SunFounder Piano Project and I plan on replacing WS2812 with a small display so it will read out 
the macro pressed. This is my first real attempt on using a Pi Pico.
